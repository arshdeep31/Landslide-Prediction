# Landslide-Prediction
Landslides are basically movement of mass of rocks, debris and earth covers down the slope. There are various reasons attached to this process like Rainfall, snow melting, earth erosion, change in water level and disturbances by human factors. Around 25-50 people are killed from landslides annually in the United States and globally this figure reaches upto thousands . Landslide susceptibility is broadly confused with landslide hazard, mainly because real hazard assessment appears to be feasible only for limited areas with excellent data coverage .The entire range of problems is encountered in the landslide assessment framework, including the quality of the input data, lack of historical evidence on landslide occurrences, absence of triggering event analyses and model evaluation, as well as interpretational difficulties on the scientistâ€“decision maker basis .
In recent years a great variety of spatial data has become publicly accessible in digital form, thus enabling the utilization of new data driven methods in processing and analyses. The emerging field of computer science which studies the algorithms that learn from the available data in order to perform processing tasks such as classification, prediction or clustering is termed as machine learning.
Landslide susceptibility has been illustrated in versatile techniques in various case studies, yielding more or less reliable results , depending on the complexity of the terrain and the suitability of the approach. The central ideas of all those studies imply the processing of the input parameters into a single output model through the various weighting, calculating and interpolating methods i.e. expert-based (heuristic) approach, deterministic (physically-based) models and machine learning techniques. The problem dealt with in the scope of landslide assessment tends to be non-linear, due to the complexity of the geological environment, as well as the factors relating to the triggering itself (storms, earthquakes, erosion, human influence, etc.). Most of those studies also signify the inevitable presence of spatial autocorrelation in every input attribute, which, if not taken into consideration could lead to erroneous results . Nowadays, there are many softwares to determine all these features for a specified land .This data can be extracted to a machine learning model to get an idea of how susceptible an area is to landslides. In this study we have made use of an open source software QGIS to extract the features of terrain and then for the process of training we derived a statistical approach to scale down if an area is susceptible to landslide and then fed the same data to various machine learning models to derive accuracy of our predictions. In the course of this study Random data points of the terrain were selected around the hilly areas of Chandigarh-Shimla Highway.
